pdf info, summary, extracting keywords

This project was created for the space app challenge organized by NASA. The challenge of the project was to create an application able to summarize and extract keywords from pdf documents. It consists of 3 .py files with each one of them with a different application. 

Even though the project applies just on one pdf document, in reality it was tested on several pdf documents and the results were quite satisfying.
